task3 a:
	q: Find the entry for the function main in the symbol table of the ELF executable (readelf -s).
	ans: 08048464

	q: In that reference you will find both the size of the function and the function's virtual address and section number.
	ans: address- 08048464, size-175

	q: In the section table of the executable, find the entry for the function's section (readelf -S).
	ans: entry of .text-080483b0

	q: Find both the section's virtual address (Addr), and the section's file offset (Off).
	ans: addr- 080483b0, offset- 0003b0

	q: Use the above information to find the file offset of the function.
	ans: (main_addr)-(.text _addr)+(.text_offset) = 8048464-80483b0+3b0 = 0x464



	q: find the offset (file location) of the function main.
	ans: 0x464
	q: find the size of the function main.
	ans: 175
	q: use your hexeditplus program to display the content of that function on the screen.
	ans: set file name to 'abc' and unit size to 1. choose option 3 (display) and enter location=464 (offset of main to abc relatively) and length=175 (main size)

task3 b:
	q: What are the first two machine instructions in function main, stated in assembly language? I.e. you need to manually dis-assemble these first two instructions.
	ans: first instruction- push (push ebp)
		 second instruction- mov (mov ebp, esp)
		 the first is push because the first byte is 55- 50 for push and +5 for ebp
		 the second is mov because the second byte is 89 (the next e5 represents ebp, esp by some encoding rules)
